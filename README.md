Thanks for helping me to get this thing ready to go for public release!  Hope it has something to offer those who are currently on their own OSCP or similar journeys.

To get started, just download the files in three files in the repo and run ./recon.sh.  The users.txt file isn't required, but you'll need to recreate something similar locally in order to run the SMTP module.

Hopefully the tool and its help menu are intuitive enough to figure out.  Please send me your comments and suggestions on Discord or Twitter.  Thanks!
